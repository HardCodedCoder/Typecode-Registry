\subsection{Domain Structure and Models}\label{subsec:domain-structure-and-models}
This subsection outlines the domain models and data structures that form the foundation of the system's data layer.
These models and structures are used across the system for data representation and transfer between the frontend and backend, ensuring consistency and integrity of the system's data.

\subsection{Data Structure Interfaces}
\label{subsec:data-structures}

The application defines a set of TypeScript interfaces to structure the data exchanged with the backend.
These interfaces enforce type safety within the Angular service methods, ensuring that the data conforms to the expected shapes and types throughout the application.
Below is a summary of the key interfaces:

    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|p{5cm}|}
        \hline
        \rowcolor{headercolor} \textbf{Interface}        & \textbf{Properties}                  & \textbf{Description} \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{Extension}}        & \texttt{project\_id, name, scope, description} & Represents details of an extension, including its scope and association with a project. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ExtensionsAPIResponse}} & \texttt{extensions: \seqsplit{ExtensionResponse[]}} & Wraps an array of \texttt{ExtensionResponse} as a response from the API. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ExtensionResponse}} & \texttt{id, project\_id, name, scope, description, creation\_date} & Detailed response object for an extension including creation date. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{FormData}}         & \texttt{extensionComboBox, extensionScope, itemName, itemTable, projectComboBox} & Captures the user input from the form fields to be sent to the backend. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ItemAPIResponse}}  & \texttt{item: ItemResponse}          & Encapsulates the \texttt{ItemResponse} received from the backend. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ItemResponse}}     & \texttt{id, name, table\_name, extensionId, creation\_date} & Represents the response structure for an item from the backend. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ProjectsAPIResponse}} & \texttt{projects: ProjectResponse[]} & Contains an array of \texttt{ProjectResponse}, representing multiple projects. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ProjectResponse}}  & \texttt{id, name, description, creation\_date} & Details of a project including its creation date. \\
        \hline
        \texttt{\seqsplit{ItemRequest}}      & \texttt{name, tableName, extension\_id} & Structure of the request sent to the backend when creating a new item. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Summary of TypeScript interfaces for data exchange}
    \label{tab:interfaces}
\end{table}

Each interface is used by the \texttt{BackendService} to communicate data structure expectations to and from the backend, providing a contract that supports the maintainability and scalability of the application.
